# Large Language Models (LLMs): Tutorial Workshop

***IMPORTANT: FORKED from Argonne's Workshop, used by permission for team preparation***

[Workshop Agenda](https://anl.app.box.com/file/1421615910690?s=woqtpw0o0tpnb6j9uljjme5wqmxsoz35)  
Authored by Argonne National Laboratory team. This repository contains the materials used in the LLM Tutorial Workshop, February 12th and 13th, 2024.
The  workshop material will rely on Jupyter Notebooks which are targeted for running on [Google's Colaboratory Platform](https://colab.research.google.com).  

## Before You Start âœ…

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Complete the following steps **BEFORE** you come to the tutorial
> 
> - [ ] [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) **Setup Account**
> 
>     <details closed><summary><code>Google Colab Instructions</code></summary>
> 
>     The Colab platform gives the user a virtual machine in which to run Python codes including machine
>     learning codes.
> 
>     The VM comes with a preinstalled environment that includes most of what is needed
>     for these tutorials.
> 
>     * You need a Google Account to use Colaboratory
>     * Go to [Google's Colaboratory Platform](https://colab.research.google.com) and sign in with
>       your Google account
>     * You should see this page
>         ![start_page](./assets/colab_start_page_new.png)
>     * Click on the `New Notebook` at the bottom
>     * Now you will see a new notebook where you can type in python code.
>         ![clean_page](./assets/colab_start_page1.png)
>     * After you enter code, type `<shift> + <enter>` to execute the code cell.
>     * A full introduction to the notebook environment is out of scope for this tutorial, but many
>       can be found with a [simple Google
>       search](https://www.google.com/search?q=jupyter+notebook+tutorial)
>     * We will be using notebooks from this repository during the tutorial, so  you should be
>       familiar with how to import them into Colaboratory
>     * Now you can open the `File` menu at the top left and select `Open Notebook` which will open a
>       dialogue box.
>     * Select the `GitHub` tab in the dialogue box.
>     * From here you can enter the url for the github repo: `https://github.com/brettin/llm_tutorial`
>       and hit `<enter>`.
>         ![open_github](./assets/colab_open_github_1.png)
>     * This will show you a list of the Notebooks available in the repo.
>     * Select the `introduction.ipynb` file to open and work through it.
>     * As each session of the tutorial begins, you will simply select the corresponding notebook from
>       this list and it will create a copy for you in your Colaboratory account (all `*.ipynb` files in
>       the Colaboratory account will be stored in your Google Drive).
>     * To use a TPU, in the notbook the select `Runtime` -> `Change Runtime Type` and you have a
>       dropbox list of hardward settings to choose from where the notebook can run.
